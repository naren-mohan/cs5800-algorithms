Pseudocode for question 1 - Intersecting LinkedLists

1. m <- Count the length of linked list with head1    (O(m))
2. n <- Count the length of linked list with head2    (O(n))
3. Get the absolute difference between the length of first and the second list: 
    offset <- abs(m - n)
4. Skip the diff_length number of nodes in the greater list 
5. Offset the longer list
    For i = 1 to offset:
        head1 <- head1.next
6. Compare the corresponding nodes from one list to the other respectievely
    While true:
        if head1.data = head2.data: 
            return head1.data 
        else:
            head1 <- head1.next
            head2 <- head2.next
